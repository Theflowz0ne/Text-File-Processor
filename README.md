# Text File Processor

This project is a simple web-based text file processor that allows users to upload a text file, specify a maximum number of characters per line, and process the file to format lines according to the specified limit. The processed text can then be downloaded as a new text file. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

This project was done to shorten subs that are more than X symbols long, and to get them to the next line softly (Not mid word).

- **Set Maximum Characters per Line:** Users can specify the maximum number of characters per line for the processed text.
- **Process Text File:** The application processes the text file, wrapping lines according to the specified limit.
